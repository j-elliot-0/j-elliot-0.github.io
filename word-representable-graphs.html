    <br>
    A graph G = (V, E) is word-representable if there exists a word w
    over V such that x and y alternate in w if and only if (x,y) is in
    E. A comprehensive introduction to the theory of word-representable
    graphs is given in the book "<a
      href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319258577">Words and
      Graphs</a>" by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim Lozin published by <i>Springer</i>.
    Also, see "<a href="http://personal.strath.ac.uk/sergey.kitaev/Papers/wrg-kitaev.pdf">A
      Comprehensive Introduction to the Theory of Word-Representable
      Graphs</a>" by Kitaev published in the <i>Lecture Notes in
      Computer Science</i> 10396. Moreover, see the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-representable_graph">wiki
      page</a> giving basic information on the theory and its
    generalizations. A key result in the theory of word-representable
    graphs is the theorem stating that a graph is word-representable if
    and only if it admits a <i>semi-transitive orientation</i>. <br>

    The user-friendly program <br>

    to work with word-representability of graphs, that requires Java
    version 7 or higher, was written by me in 2014-15, and it is
    based on the notion of a semi-transitive orientation. This program
    presents a graph in matrix form on the left, and in graphical form
    on the right. Edges are added/removed by clicking on the appropriate
    entry in the matrix. The program presents the following
    functionality: <br>
    <br>
    <b class="par">M</b>anipulating the graph <br>
    <br>
    Controls for manipulating the graph are on the left-hand side panel.
    There is an "oriented/non-oriented" pair of radio buttons, which
    toggles which type of edge is placed on the graph. The up and down
    arrows decrease and increase the size of the matrix respectively
    (that is, removes the highest vertex, or adds a new one). The
    "clear" button completely removes all edges from the current graph.<br>
    <br>
    <b class="par">C</b>hecking for word-representability <br>
    <br>
    Controls for checking the word-representability of a graph are at
    the bottom of the window. The button "Is this orientation
    semi-transitive?" checks whether the given fully-oriented graph is
    semi-transitively oriented. The button "Is this graph
    word-representable?" checks whether a given (non-oriented) graph is
    word-representable, and if it is, it outputs a semi-transitive
    orientation of the graph, and a uniform word representing it. If you
    orient some (but not all) edges before clicking the button, these
    will be used as clues for what kind of orientation a semi-transitive
    orientation may be. So for example, if you orient one particular
    edge in one way, the program will not check any of the oriented
    graphs where that edge was oriented the other way, when searching
    for a semi-transitive orientation. The button "Get word representing
    this graph" will show a uniform word representing the current graph,
    if the graph is indeed word-representable, and will allow the user
    to save that word to a file.<br>
